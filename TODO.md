Todo
==========

Following things needs to be done or are planned to be coded. 
Feel free to post a pull request if you get following things working:

* Fix support for 1.8 (mostly map packet and packet that causes errors in console)
* Fix occasional crashes on 1.6.4 and general packet unstability.
* Entities - spawning is done (/spawn), metadata partially (/meta). I plan make killing entities possible
  and also some simple AI.
* Inventory-related stuff. Survival inventory is messed up, creative works relativly stable.
* Implement Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 world generator OR fix current Alpha generator.
* Player and entity movement and position detection.
* Bukkit API support, including permissions and plugins.
